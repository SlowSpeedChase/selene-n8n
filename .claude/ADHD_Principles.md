# ADHD Management System: Core Principles & Requirements

## System Purpose
Create a digital prosthetic executive function system for ADHD brains that externalizes working memory, makes time visible, and supports emotional regulation.

## Foundational ADHD Characteristics

### Neurological Differences
- **Information Processing**: ADHD brains receive 5-6 tasks simultaneously (lottery balls) vs. neurotypical sequential processing (gumball machine)
- **Time Blindness**: Experiences time as "all the time in the world or no time" rather than measurable units
- **Working Direction**: Top-down (visualize finished product first, then lose interest) vs. bottom-up (build motivation through steps)
- **Dopamine Dysregulation**: Makes sustained focus difficult
- **Object Permanence Issues**: "Out of sight, out of mind"
- **Weaker Prefrontal Cortex**: Affects attention, behavior, emotion, planning, and sequencing

### Key Principle
ADHD brains cannot reliably hold and manipulate information mentally—they need **external, visual systems**.

## The 3-Step Framework

### 1. CAPTURE (The Dumpster)
**Purpose**: Externalize all thoughts to reduce mental load

**Requirements**:
- Single collection point for ALL incoming information
- **O.H.I.O. Principle**: Only Hold It Once
- No organization at capture stage—just dump
- Must reduce decision fatigue
- Prevents mental looping of the same 5-6 thoughts

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- Quick capture interface (minimal friction)
- No categorization required at entry
- Timestamp all captures
- Mobile and desktop accessible

---

### 2. ORGANIZE (Mind-Maps)
**Purpose**: Visual organization matching ADHD cognitive style

**Two Types Required**:

#### **WTF Mind-Map** (What needs to be done)
- Replaces linear to-do lists
- Center circle = main area of life/focus
- Branches = categories/projects
- Sub-branches = specific tasks
- Numbered priorities on branches

#### **Project Mind-Map** (How to accomplish specific tasks)
- Center circle = specific project
- Branches = major steps
- Sub-branches = action items
- Shows big picture AND details simultaneously

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- Visual/spatial interface (not list-based)
- Ability to see hierarchy at a glance
- Easy to add branches and sub-items
- Numbering/prioritization capability
- Should feel more like drawing than data entry

---

### 3. PLAN (Making Time Visible)
**Purpose**: Convert organized tasks into visible time blocks

**Four Planning Views Required**:

#### **Monthly View**
- Calendar showing deadlines
- Repeating appointments
- Big-picture planning
- Shows what's coming

#### **Weekly View** ⭐ CRITICAL
- **Structured Time**: Already committed (work, appointments) - shown clearly
- **Unstructured Time**: Free time available - MUST BE VISIBLE
- Key insight: ADHD brains need to SEE free time to stay motivated
- Shows balance between committed and available time

#### **Daily View**
- Hour-by-hour breakdown (e.g., 6:30am-7:00pm)
- Fill structured time first
- Place Mind-Map tasks in remaining slots
- **Critical**: Under-schedule, not over-schedule
- Use realistic time estimates, not idealistic

#### **Moment View** (Current Focus Tracker)
- Shows: Current task + Start time
- Acts as "bookmark" when distractions occur
- Prevents getting lost in "cyber-vortex"
- Brings user back to intended task

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- All four views must be easily accessible
- Visual distinction between structured/unstructured time
- Drag-and-drop from Mind-Map to time slots
- Timer/current task display always visible
- Automatic time tracking for reality checks

---

## Long-Term Planning Wall (Future-Focused)

### Components Needed:

#### **Future Ideas Board**
- Captures long-term ideas (not immediate action items)
- Visible but separate from current work

#### **Current Projects Board**
- Multi-month active projects
- Maximum 3-5 at once to prevent overwhelm

#### **Project Mind-Maps**
- Detailed breakdown for each active project
- Linked to Current Projects Board

#### **Year Calendar**
- Full year visible at once
- Shows major deadlines and milestones

#### **3-Month Rolling Calendar**
- Detailed view of next 90 days
- Shows structured vs. unstructured time over longer period

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- Dashboard that shows all components simultaneously
- Clear visual separation between "someday/maybe" and "active now"
- Ability to move items from Future → Current → Mind-Map → Daily Plan
- Zoom levels: Year → Quarter → Month → Week → Day

## Critical Design Principles

### Visual Over Mental
- **Rule**: If it's not visible, it doesn't exist (to the ADHD brain)
- Everything must be externalizable
- Minimize reliance on memory

### Realistic Over Idealistic
- System must encourage under-scheduling
- Use actual time blocks, not estimates
- Build in buffer time

### Reduce Friction
- Capture must be instantaneous
- No complex categorization required
- Minimal clicks/steps between thought and system

### Balance is Essential
- Must show BOTH committed time AND free time
- Without seeing free time, ADHD brain feels trapped and rebels

### Work Backwards
- Start with arrival time → calculate departure time
- Start with deadline → work backwards to start date

### Schedule Downtime First
- Show ADHD brain where it can "play"
- Increases compliance with scheduled work time

---

## Emotional Regulation Integration

### Awareness Tools Needed

#### **Overwhelm Pattern Tracker**
Captures:
- What am I doing? (behaviors)
- What am I thinking? (thoughts)
- What am I feeling? (emotions)

Creates awareness of personal overwhelm signature

#### **Mindset Shift Tools**
- **"...and that's ok!"** phrase integration
- Automatic reframe from amygdala (panic) to frontal cortex (problem-solving)
- Shifts from "I can't..." → "I can't... and that's ok! But I can..."

#### **Daily Thought Tracker**
- 3-4 timed check-ins per day
- Captures negative thoughts
- Prompts positive replacement thoughts
- Builds neural pathways away from limiting beliefs

### STOP & PIVOT Technique Support
System should prompt:
1. **STOP**: Notice negative thought
2. **PIVOT**: Replace with empowering belief or gratitude
3. Hold positive feeling for 90+ seconds

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- Timed prompts/notifications
- Quick logging interface for emotional check-ins
- Library of empowering beliefs/affirmations
- Progress tracking on mindset shifts

---

## Evening Mindfulness Ritual Support

**3-Step Process** (should be prompted daily):
1. List 3-5 things that **went well today**
2. Set an **intention for tomorrow** (review planned schedule)
3. Release: "Tell your mind to let it all go"

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- Evening prompt (customizable time)
- Quick gratitude entry
- Tomorrow's schedule preview
- Simple close/completion action

---

## Procrastination Management

### Two-Step Framework

#### **Step 1: Identify Resistance**
System should help identify WHY avoiding task:
- Don't know where to start
- Too boring/not interesting
- Fear of failure/imperfection
- Feeling trapped
- Need more information
- Already delayed (guilt)

#### **Step 2: Reframe**
System prompts:
- Get realistic, not idealistic
- Identify personal benefit
- Suggest creative solutions

**Digital Implementation Needs**:
- "I'm stuck" button on any task
- Guided questionnaire for resistance type
- Suggestion engine for reframes
- Break-down-the-task wizard

---

## Additional Support Tools

### Meeting/Call Sheets
- Template for capturing notes during meetings
- Automatic follow-up item extraction
- Links to relevant Mind-Maps or projects

### "Help I'm Stuck" Guide
System troubleshoots:
- What to do (refers to Mind-Maps)
- How to do it (breaks down steps)
- When to do it (checks schedule for time)

### Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Support
- "What Do I Need?" prompt when emotional
- Focuses on self-awareness, not blame
- Counters cognitive distortions with success reminders

---

## Key Success Metrics

A successful digital system will:

1. ✅ **Externalize working memory** - nothing important lives only in user's head
2. ✅ **Make time visible** - structured and unstructured time always clear
3. ✅ **Match ADHD cognitive style** - visual, spatial, non-linear
4. ✅ **Reduce decision fatigue** - minimal choices at point of capture
5. ✅ **Show the whole picture** - big picture and details simultaneously visible
6. ✅ **Support emotional regulation** - prompts for mindset shifts integrated
7. ✅ **Encourage realistic planning** - prevents over-scheduling
8. ✅ **Minimize friction** - fast capture, easy organization, simple planning
9. ✅ **Maintain object permanence** - everything stays visible/findable
10. ✅ **Support the "bookmark" function** - easy to return to intended task after distraction

## System Philosophy Summary

**The Goal**: Create a digital prosthetic executive function that does what the ADHD brain cannot do reliably on its own:
- Hold multiple pieces of information simultaneously
- Prioritize by importance (not interest)
- Estimate time realistically
- Maintain object permanence
- Regulate emotions through awareness

**The Method**: Make everything external, visual, and simple. Trust the system, not the brain's faulty working memory.

**The Non-Negotiable**: If the system is too complex, requires too many decisions, or isn't immediately visible, the ADHD brain will abandon it. Simplicity and visibility are paramount.
