## Ready for Implementation Checklist

Before creating a branch, all items must be checked:

- [ ] **Acceptance criteria defined** - How do we know it's done?
- [ ] **ADHD check passed** - See below
- [ ] **Scope check** - Can ship in < 1 week of focused work?
- [ ] **No blockers** - Dependencies resolved?

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

### ADHD Design Check

- [ ] **Reduces friction?** (fewer steps/decisions)
- [ ] **Visible?** (won't be forgotten)
- [ ] **Externalizes cognition?** (system remembers, not user)

*If a feature fails all three, reconsider if it belongs in Selene.*
