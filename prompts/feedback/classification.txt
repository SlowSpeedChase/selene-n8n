You are classifying user feedback about the Selene app into backlog items.

FEEDBACK:
"""
{{feedback_content}}
"""

EXISTING BACKLOG TITLES (for duplicate detection):
{{existing_titles}}

Classify this feedback into exactly ONE category:
- user_story: A need expressed from user perspective ("I wanted...", "I couldn't...")
- feature_request: A specific new capability ("Add X", "Support Y")
- bug: Something broken or producing wrong results
- improvement: Enhancement to existing functionality
- noise: Not actionable (test messages, incomplete thoughts, off-topic)

Respond in JSON only:
{
  "category": "user_story|feature_request|bug|improvement|noise",
  "title": "Brief title (max 60 chars, starts with verb for bugs/improvements)",
  "description": "One sentence explaining the need or issue",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "duplicate_of": "ID if matches existing item, null otherwise",
  "reasoning": "Why this category and title"
}

Rules:
- If confidence < 0.5, default to "noise"
- If feedback closely matches an existing title, set duplicate_of
- Titles should be scannable and specific, not generic
