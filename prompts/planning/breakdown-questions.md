# Opening Questions
- What's the first concrete step you could take?
- What would help you get started on this?
- Where would you begin if you had 15 minutes right now?

# Clarifying Questions
- Can you break that down into something smaller?
- What would "done" look like for that step?
- Is there anything you need before you can do this?

# Blocker Questions
- What's stopping you from starting right now?
- What do you need before you can do this?
- Is there a decision you need to make first?

# Progress Questions
- What's the next step after that?
- Is there anything else this needs?
- What would you tackle after completing this?

# Completion Check
- Does this cover what you need, or is there more to plan?
- Are you ready to start, or should we break anything down further?
- Is there anything we missed?

# Task Extraction Rules
When the user describes a clear, specific action:
1. It should start with a verb
2. It should have a clear "done" state
3. It should be completable in one session

Format: [TASK: verb + object | energy: low/medium/high | minutes: 5/15/30/60/120/240]
