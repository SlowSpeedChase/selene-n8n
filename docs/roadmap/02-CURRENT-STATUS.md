# Selene n8n - Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31

## Summary

Phase 1 is **COMPLETE**. The core ingestion and LLM processing pipeline is working with 10 notes successfully processed.

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Minimal Viable System

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Completed:** October 30, 2025
**Goal:** Get ONE note flowing through the entire pipeline

#### What Works

1. **Drafts Integration** ✅
   - Action script sends notes to n8n webhook
   - Success/error messages display in Drafts
   - Payload includes: uuid, title, content, tags, created timestamp

2. **Database Storage** ✅
   - Notes stored in `raw_notes` table
   - SQLite database created with full schema
   - 10 notes captured successfully

3. **LLM Processing (v2.0)** ✅
   - Ollama extracts concepts with confidence scores
   - Ollama identifies themes with confidence scores
   - **NEW:** Sentiment analysis (overall_sentiment, sentiment_score, emotional_tone, energy_level)
   - Results stored in `processed_notes` table
   - Processes pending notes every 30 seconds

4. **Data Quality** ✅
   - All 10 notes have concepts extracted
   - All 10 notes have themes identified
   - All 10 notes have sentiment analyzed
   - Confidence scores calculated and stored
   - Process completes in < 30 seconds per note

#### Workflows Built

- **01-ingestion/workflow.json** ✅
  - Webhook trigger at `/webhook/selene/ingest`
  - Validates incoming data
  - Inserts into `raw_notes`
  - Returns success response

- **02-llm-processing/workflow.json** ✅ (v2.0)
  - Cron trigger (every 30 seconds)
  - Queries pending notes from database
  - Calls Ollama for concept extraction
  - Calls Ollama for theme detection
  - **NEW:** Calls Ollama for sentiment analysis
  - Calculates confidence scores
  - Inserts into `processed_notes`
  - Updates `raw_notes` status to 'processed'

#### Test Results

```bash
# Database query results (as of 2025-10-30)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM raw_notes;           # 10 notes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM processed_notes;     # 10 notes
SELECT AVG(confidence_score) FROM processed_notes;  # ~0.82 (good quality)
```

#### Known Issues

- None currently - Phase 1 stable and working

## In-Progress Phases

### 🔨 Phase 1.5: UUID Tracking Foundation

**Status:** PLANNED (Starting 2025-11-01)
**Priority:** HIGH - Foundational improvement
**Goal:** Add source UUID tracking for draft identification and edit detection

#### Overview

Add `source_uuid` field to track individual drafts by their UUID. This enables:
- Precise draft identification ("did draft X get processed?")
- Edit detection (update existing record when draft is modified)
- Foundation for version tracking and edit history
- Link database records back to original drafts

#### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Database Foundation** - Add `source_uuid` column and index
2. **Phase 2: Capture UUIDs** - Update Drafts action to send UUID
3. **Phase 3: Store UUIDs** - Update workflow to store UUID
4. **Phase 4: UUID-First Logic** - Implement UUID-based duplicate detection with edit support
5. **Phase 5: Integration Testing** - Verify new draft, duplicate, and edit scenarios

#### Strategy: UUID-First with Override

- If UUID exists in DB → Check if content changed
  - Content same → Skip (duplicate)
  - Content different → Update existing record (edit detected)
- If UUID is new → Check content_hash for accidental duplicates
  - Content exists → Skip
  - Content new → Insert new record
- If no UUID provided → Fall back to content_hash (backward compatible)

**Time Estimate:** 4-5 hours (incremental over 1-2 days)

See [09-UUID-TRACKING-FOUNDATION.md](./09-UUID-TRACKING-FOUNDATION.md) for complete plan.

### ⬜ Phase 2: Obsidian Export

**Status:** NOT STARTED (After Phase 1.5)
**Next Up:** To be implemented after UUID tracking
**Goal:** Export processed notes to Obsidian vault

#### Tasks Remaining

1. ⬜ Create Obsidian vault directory structure
2. ⬜ Build n8n workflow `04-obsidian-export/workflow.json`
3. ⬜ Test with 5-10 notes
4. ⬜ Verify Obsidian links work

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 hours

See [04-PHASE-2-OBSIDIAN.md](./04-PHASE-2-OBSIDIAN.md) for details.

---

## Upcoming Phases

### ⬜ Phase 3: Pattern Detection

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Detect theme trends and concept clusters

See [05-PHASE-3-PATTERNS.md](./05-PHASE-3-PATTERNS.md)

### ⬜ Phase 4: Polish & Enhancements

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Error handling, batch processing, custom themes

See [06-PHASE-4-POLISH.md](./06-PHASE-4-POLISH.md)

### ⬜ Phase 5: ADHD Executive Function Features

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Task extraction, mind-maps, emotional regulation tools

See [07-PHASE-5-ADHD.md](./07-PHASE-5-ADHD.md)

### ⬜ Phase 6: Event-Driven Architecture

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Convert time-based triggers to event-driven workflow execution

See [08-PHASE-6-EVENT-DRIVEN.md](./08-PHASE-6-EVENT-DRIVEN.md)

- **Database**: `/selene/data/selene.db` (SQLite)
- **Ollama**: localhost:11434
- **Ollama Model**: mistral:7b
- **Drafts Action**: Configured and working

### Workflows Active

| Workflow | Status | Trigger | Frequency |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 01-ingestion | ✅ Active | Webhook | On-demand |

| 06-connection-network | ⬜ Not built | - | - |

### Database Stats

```sql
-- Notes captured
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM raw_notes WHERE status = 'processed';
-- Result: 10

-- Average confidence
SELECT AVG(confidence_score) FROM processed_notes;
-- Result: 0.82

-- Sentiment breakdown
SELECT overall_sentiment, COUNT(*) FROM processed_notes GROUP BY overall_sentiment;
-- Result: varies by notes

-- Most common themes
SELECT theme, COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT json_each.value as theme
  FROM processed_notes, json_each(processed_notes.themes)
) GROUP BY theme ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 5;
-- Result: depends on note content
```

## Next Actions

### For Development

1. **Start Phase 1.5** (UUID Tracking Foundation) - PRIORITY
   - Read [09-UUID-TRACKING-FOUNDATION.md](./09-UUID-TRACKING-FOUNDATION.md)
   - Phase 1: Add `source_uuid` column to database
   - Phase 2: Update Drafts action to send UUID
   - Phase 3: Update workflow to store UUID
   - Phase 4: Implement UUID-first duplicate logic
   - Phase 5: Test new draft, duplicate, and edit scenarios

2. **Start Phase 2** (Obsidian Export) - After Phase 1.5
   - Read [04-PHASE-2-OBSIDIAN.md](./04-PHASE-2-OBSIDIAN.md)
   - Create vault directory structure
   - Build export workflow

2. **Test Current System**
   - Send 5 more notes through pipeline
   - Verify all processing still works
   - Check database for anomalies

3. **Consider Phase 6** (Event-Driven)
   - Current cron-based approach works but inefficient
   - [08-PHASE-6-EVENT-DRIVEN.md](./08-PHASE-6-EVENT-DRIVEN.md) shows better architecture
   - Could implement before or after Phase 2

### For Maintenance

1. **Monitor Database**
   - Check for stuck notes: `SELECT * FROM raw_notes WHERE status = 'pending' AND created_at < datetime('now', '-5 minutes')`
   - Verify LLM quality: `SELECT AVG(confidence_score) FROM processed_notes WHERE processed_at > datetime('now', '-24 hours')`

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - No automated backups yet
   - Consider adding in Phase 4

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep this file updated as work progresses
   - Mark tasks complete when done
   - Add completion dates

---

## Questions to Consider

Before starting Phase 2, decide:

1. **Vault Location**
   - Use existing Obsidian vault?
   - Create new dedicated Selene vault?
   - Path configuration?

2. **Export Format**
   - How should concept links look?
   - Include full metadata or summary?
   - Export frequency (hourly? on-demand?)?

3. **Phase 6 Timing**
   - Implement event-driven architecture now or later?
   - Current cron approach works but suboptimal
   - Could be done before Phase 2 for better foundation
