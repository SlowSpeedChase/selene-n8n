# Design Documents Index

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-21

Design docs are the planning unit for Selene development. Each doc captures an idea, architecture, and implementation plan.

---

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Next Step |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Vision** | Idea captured, needs refinement | Add acceptance criteria, ADHD check, scope check |
| **Ready** | Implementation-ready | Create branch, start GitOps workflow |
| **In Progress** | Branch exists, being built | Complete GitOps stages |
| **Done** | Implemented and merged | Archive if old |

**A design is "Ready" when it has:**
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] ADHD check passed (reduces friction? visible? externalizes cognition?)
- [ ] Scope check passed (< 1 week of focused work)
- [ ] No blockers

---

## Vision (Needs Refinement)

Ideas captured but not yet ready for implementation.

## Deprioritized

Designs that are ready but not currently a priority. These are bundled together for future implementation.

| Date | Document | Topic | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 2026-01-26 | phase-7.3-cloud-ai-integration.md | cloud-ai | Privacy-preserving cloud AI with sanitization |
| 2026-01-26 | phase-7.3-implementation-plan.md | cloud-ai | 21 tasks, implementation ready |
| 2026-01-11 | things-checklist-integration-design.md | things | Checklist generation - benefits from Cloud AI |

**Bundle rationale:** Things checklist generation uses LLM for task breakdown. Local Ollama produces adequate results, but Cloud AI would significantly improve quality. Implement together when Cloud AI is prioritized.

## Workflow

### Creating a Design Doc

1. Use brainstorming skill to explore the idea
2. Write to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md`
3. Add entry to this INDEX in "Vision" section
4. Status: **Vision**

### Making It Ready

1. Add acceptance criteria (testable)
2. Complete ADHD check
3. Verify scope (< 1 week)
4. Move to "Ready" section
5. Status: **Ready**

### Starting Implementation

1. Create branch: `git worktree add -b feature-name .worktrees/feature-name main`
2. Copy BRANCH-STATUS.md template
3. Move doc to "In Progress" section
4. Follow GitOps stages (see `.claude/GITOPS.md`)
5. Status: **In Progress**

### Completing

1. Merge to main
2. Move doc to "Done" section
3. Complete closure ritual
4. Status: **Done**
