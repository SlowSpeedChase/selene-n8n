# Test Data Isolation Design

**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Status:** Approved
**Purpose:** Prevent Claude Code from accessing production data during testing and debugging

---

## Problem

Claude Code has access to the entire repo directory, including:
- `data/selene.db` - Production database with real personal notes
- `vault/` - Obsidian vault with real exported notes

When running tests or debugging workflows, Claude can query and read this data, which then appears in conversation context and potentially leaves the local machine.

## Solution

Move production data outside the repo to a location Claude Code cannot access. Keep synthetic test data inside the repo for development and testing.

---

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

**Production data (outside repo - inaccessible to Claude):**
```
~/selene-data/
├── selene.db              # Real notes database
└── obsidian-vault/        # Real Obsidian exports
```

**Test data (inside repo - accessible to Claude):**
```
~/selene-n8n/
├── data-test/
│   └── selene-test.db     # 18 synthetic notes
├── vault-test/            # Synthetic Obsidian exports
└── ...
```

### Data Flow

```

                    │   Webhook Request       │

                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │
                    ┌───────────▼─────────────┐

## Components

### 1. Startup Script

**File:** `./scripts/start-n8n-local.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Production paths (default)
export SELENE_DB_PATH="${SELENE_DB_PATH:-$HOME/selene-data/selene.db}"
export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-$HOME/selene-data/obsidian-vault}"

# Test paths (for reference in workflows)
export SELENE_TEST_DB_PATH="$PWD/data-test/selene-test.db"
export OBSIDIAN_TEST_VAULT_PATH="$PWD/vault-test"

# Start n8n
export N8N_USER_FOLDER="$PWD/.n8n-local"
n8n start
```

**Behavior:**
- Production mode is the default (no flags needed)
- Test paths exported for workflow access
- Zero-friction startup for normal use

### 2. Workflow Modification Pattern

**Every function node accessing the database uses:**

```javascript
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');

// Check for test mode from incoming data
const useTestDb = $json.use_test_db || false;

// Select database path
const dbPath = useTestDb
  ? process.env.SELENE_TEST_DB_PATH
  : process.env.SELENE_DB_PATH;

const db = new Database(dbPath);

try {
  // ... existing database logic unchanged ...
} finally {
  db.close();
}
```

**Pass flag to downstream nodes:**
```javascript
return {
  json: {
    ...result,
    use_test_db: $json.use_test_db || false
  }
};
```

**Affected workflows:** 01, 02, 02_apple, 03, 05, 06, 07, 08, 10, 11

### 3. Test Script Pattern

**All test scripts include the flag:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/api/drafts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Note",
    "content": "Test content",
    "test_run": "'"$TEST_RUN"'",
    "use_test_db": true
  }'
```

### 4. Migration Script

**File:** `./scripts/setup-test-isolation.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Setting up test isolation..."

# Create production data directory
mkdir -p ~/selene-data/obsidian-vault

# Move production data (if exists in repo)
if [ -f "./data/selene.db" ]; then
  echo "Moving production database to ~/selene-data/"
  mv ./data/selene.db ~/selene-data/
fi

if [ -d "./vault" ] && [ "$(ls -A ./vault 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
  echo "Moving Obsidian vault to ~/selene-data/obsidian-vault/"
  mv ./vault/* ~/selene-data/obsidian-vault/
fi

# Create test directories
mkdir -p ./data-test ./vault-test

# Create placeholder files for git
touch ./data-test/.gitkeep ./vault-test/.gitkeep

echo "Done. Production data is now at ~/selene-data/"
echo "Test data will be at ./data-test/ and ./vault-test/"
```

### 5. Seed Script

**File:** `./scripts/seed-test-data.sh`

Creates test database with 18 synthetic notes covering:
- 4 task extraction test cases (actionable, needs_planning, archive_only, edge case)
- 4 sentiment analysis test cases (positive, negative, neutral, mixed)
- 4 pattern detection test cases (recurring sleep theme, work-life theme)
- 3 connection network test cases (overlapping concepts)
- 3 special cases (feedback routing, duplicate detection, edit detection)

## Error Handling

### Missing Database Path
```javascript
const dbPath = useTestDb
  ? process.env.SELENE_TEST_DB_PATH
  : process.env.SELENE_DB_PATH;

if (!dbPath) {
  throw new Error('Database path not configured. Run ./scripts/start-n8n-local.sh');
}
```

### Missing Test Database
Seed script creates database if missing:
```bash
if [ ! -f "$TEST_DB" ]; then
  sqlite3 "$TEST_DB" < ./database/schema.sql
fi
```

### Forgotten Flag in Test
- Test still runs but hits production DB
- Mitigated by: all repo test scripts include flag by default
- Claude Code copies from existing scripts

---

## Implementation Tasks

1. Create migration script (`setup-test-isolation.sh`)
2. Create seed script (`seed-test-data.sh`)
3. Update startup script with environment variables
4. Modify all workflow function nodes (11 workflows)
5. Update all test scripts to include `use_test_db: true`
6. Update documentation (CLAUDE.md, OPERATIONS.md)
7. Run migration (user action)
8. Verify tests pass with isolated data

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Production data lives at `~/selene-data/`
- [ ] Claude Code cannot access production database
- [ ] `./scripts/start-n8n-local.sh` works without any flags
- [ ] All test scripts use `use_test_db: true`
- [ ] Seed script creates reproducible test data
- [ ] All existing tests pass against test database
