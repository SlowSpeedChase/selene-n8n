## Why share Selene now?

I want to build in the world—get feedback, hear how others would approach this, maybe help people with the same problem.

I hate typing. I like being out in the world, capturing things as they come to me. That's the low-stress part. What stresses me out is the overhead work afterward: reviewing, tracking, maintaining, organizing. I want a process and a helper on rails to be my librarian. All the benefit, less of the work that drains me.

It's local. Your machine. Secure. No cloud services getting my data. Once I get rid of Drafts, even less leakage. I'm tired of giving my data to people who don't need it.

And with local LLMs, we don't need to anymore. Not for things like this. I don't need Claude to do it for me—I can have Claude help me write the code to do it myself, the way I want to do it.

## What I worked on today

- Started thinking about how to talk about Selene publicly
- Realized the framing is personal ("I needed this") not product ("use this")
- Set up dev journal in `docs/journal/`

## Decisions

- Dev journal lives in the repo, version controlled
- Focus on building in public, not launching

## Stuck on / Uncertain

Whether this project will amount to anything useful—or if I'm just wasting my time.

**What would make it worth it:** If it can take a single thought I have and help me successfully take action on it.
