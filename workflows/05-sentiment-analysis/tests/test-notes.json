My brain is racing between tasks - the Docker setup, the sentiment analysis workflow, updating documentation, fixing bugs in the API. I keep starting one thing, then remembering another thing I need to do, then jumping to that. Can't handle all of this at once. I'm drowning in tasks and don't know where to start.

    "content": "Been at this Docker networking issue for the past 6 hours straight. Lost track of time completely. Started at 2pm, looked up and it's 8pm already. I'm completely dialed in on this problem. The issue is with the bridge network configuration between n8n and Ollama containers. I've traced through the network stack, analyzed the DNS resolution, checked the host.docker.internal mapping, and I finally figured it out. The container startup order matters because the network bridge needs to be established before the API calls. I'm in the zone and don't want to stop now.",

All the options feel equally important and overwhelming. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow. Or maybe I should organize my notes first. But then I'd need to decide how to organize them. This is stuck.

    "title": "Creative Solution Found",
    "content": "Had a breakthrough moment today! I was working on the sentiment analysis and suddenly connected three different concepts that I didn't realize were related. The ADHD pattern detection could use the same approach as the theme extraction, but with emotional markers instead of topics. And this connects to how we could build a recommendation engine that suggests similar notes based on emotional state. My brain just made these rapid connections and now I see the whole architecture clearly. This is why I love building systems - when it clicks, it REALLY clicks. The pattern recognition ability and seeing connections others miss is such a strength.",

The sentiment analysis is working well for most cases, but the JSON parsing keeps failing on edge cases. I'm proud of what I've built so far, but annoyed that these little issues keep popping up.
